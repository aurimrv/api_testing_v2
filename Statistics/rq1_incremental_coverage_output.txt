     INCREMENTAL TEST COVERAGE ANALYSIS
     Instruction Coverage & Branch Coverage
=================================================================

DATA STRUCTURE:
---------------
Test sets are INCREMENTAL (nested/cumulative):
  T0: Initial test set (baseline)
  T1: T0 + additional tests (superset of T0)
  T2: T1 + additional tests (superset of T1)
  T3: T2 + additional tests (superset of T2)

Research Question: Does coverage significantly improve as we
add more tests to the test suite?

1. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Test_Set   Mean Median        SD   Min   Max Range
       T0 76.252  82.94 27.163127 28.82 96.77 67.95
       T1 79.658  84.02 24.572314 37.36 97.28 59.92

       T3 89.856  87.67  9.535595 76.63 99.83 23.20

INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS:
  T0 → T1: Mean Δ = 3.41% (from 76.25% to 79.66%)
  T1 → T2: Mean Δ = 9.21% (from 79.66% to 88.87%)
  T2 → T3: Mean Δ = 0.99% (from 88.87% to 89.86%)
  T0 → T3: Mean Δ = 13.60% (from 76.25% to 89.86%) [TOTAL]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2. SHAPIRO-WILK NORMALITY TEST (α = 0.05)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing normality of DIFFERENCES (appropriate for paired tests):

 Comparison W_Statistic P_Value         Normal
    T1 - T0      0.8030  0.0857 Yes (p ≥ 0.05)
    T2 - T1      0.6140  0.0010  No (p < 0.05)
    T3 - T2      0.9329  0.6161 Yes (p ≥ 0.05)
    T3 - T0      0.6863  0.0068  No (p < 0.05)

INTERPRETATION:
At least one set of differences is non-normal.
→ NON-PARAMETRIC tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank) are appropriate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
3. WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST (Paired, One-Tailed)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hypothesis for each comparison:
  H0: No improvement in coverage (median difference ≤ 0)
  H1: Coverage INCREASES (median difference > 0)
  Alternative: 'greater' (one-tailed test)
  Significance level: α = 0.05

 Comparison Median_Diff V_Statistic P_Value    Significant  Direction
   T0 vs T1        1.08          15  0.0295 Yes (p < 0.05) Increase ↑
   T1 vs T2        3.14          15  0.0295 Yes (p < 0.05) Increase ↑
   T2 vs T3        1.07          15  0.0295 Yes (p < 0.05) Increase ↑
   T0 vs T3        5.26          15  0.0295 Yes (p < 0.05) Increase ↑

-------------------------------------------------------------------
4. EFFECT SIZE ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating effect size (r = Z / sqrt(N)) for significant comparisons:

T0 vs T1:
  Effect size r ≈ 0.844 (Large effect)
  → Statistically significant improvement (p = 0.0295)

T1 vs T2:
  Effect size r ≈ 0.844 (Large effect)
  → Statistically significant improvement (p = 0.0295)

T2 vs T3:
  Effect size r ≈ 0.844 (Large effect)
  → Statistically significant improvement (p = 0.0295)

T0 vs T3:
  Effect size r ≈ 0.844 (Large effect)
  → Statistically significant improvement (p = 0.0295)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
5. DETAILED INTERPRETATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERALL TREND: Instruction Coverage coverage ranges from 76.25% (T0) to 89.86% (T3)

RESULT: ALL comparisons show statistically significant improvements!
Each increment of tests (T0→T1, T1→T2, T2→T3, and overall T0→T3)
leads to significant coverage gains. This demonstrates:
  - Consistent and meaningful improvements at each stage
  - Each new test batch contributes to coverage growth
  - The incremental approach is effective

4. EFFECT SIZE ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating effect size (r = Z / sqrt(N)) for significant comparisons:

T0 vs T1:
  Effect size r ≈ 0.400 (Medium effect)
  → Not statistically significant (p = 0.1855)

  Effect size r ≈ 0.735 (Large effect)
  → Not statistically significant (p = 0.0502)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
5. DETAILED INTERPRETATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERALL TREND: Branch Coverage coverage ranges from 74.16% (T0) to 89.95% (T3)

RESULT: No statistically significant improvements detected.
Despite incremental test additions, coverage improvements are not
significant at the 0.05 level. This could indicate:
  - The additional tests don't target new code areas
  - Coverage was already high at baseline (ceiling effect)
  - Sample size is too small to detect improvements

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------
• Instruction Coverage: 4/4 comparisons significant
• Branch Coverage: 0/4 comparisons significant

→ Instruction coverage shows MORE significant improvements than branch coverage.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------
⚡ MIXED results - one metric improves significantly, the other doesn't.
  Investigate why instruction and branch coverage diverge.
